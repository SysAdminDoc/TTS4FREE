## Why BetterTTS?

Every cloud TTS service gates you behind signups, character limits, and paid tiers. BetterTTS runs the full Kokoro 82M neural model locally in your browser via WebGPU or WASM — your text never leaves your device. No API keys, no queue, no watermarks, no 10,000-character monthly cap.

## Features

### Audio Generation
- **Kokoro 82M** neural TTS via `kokoro-js` + Transformers.js — top-tier voice quality (MOS 4.3-4.5)
- **Supertonic speed engine** via Transformers.js — 10 English F/M voices, 44.1 kHz fp32 output, lazy-loaded only when selected
- **28 English voices** — 12 US female, 9 US male, 4 British female, 4 British male, each with quality grades
- **WebGPU acceleration** with automatic WASM q8 fallback for devices without GPU support
- **Pages-hosted WASM q8 model** with Hugging Face fallback and 429-aware retry; WebGPU fp32 stays HF-hosted because it exceeds the Pages file cap
- **Web Worker inference** — generation runs off the main thread so the UI stays responsive
- **Streaming playback** — audio plays as each sentence is synthesized, no waiting for the full run
- **Web Speech API fallback** — device-native voices when Kokoro can't run, with full browser voice picker

### Export & Output
- **WAV** (lossless), **MP3** (96/128/160 kbps), and **Opus/WebM** (via WebCodecs AudioEncoder, where supported) export
- **Per-line generation** with individual files + automatic ZIP bundle
- **SRT and VTT subtitle export** with sentence-level timing, plus opt-in word-level cues from the timestamped Kokoro model
- **Persistent clip library** — generated clips saved to IndexedDB, survive page reloads
- **Web Share** for sharing audio files directly from the app (Android Chrome)
- **Native save dialog** via `showSaveFilePicker` on Chromium, with `<a download>` fallback

### Audio Processing
- **Pitch control** - +/-4 semitones via Signalsmith Stretch AudioWorklet/WASM rendering, without tempo change
- **Background music mixing** — upload any audio file, loop to speech length, mix at adjustable volume
- **Silence insertion** — `[pause 2s]` tags splice real silence into the output
- **Speed control** — 0.5x to 1.5x playback rate

### Studio Features
- **Dialog mode** — `[speaker:Alice]` line prefixes map to different voices for multi-character scripts
- **Follow-along transcript** — click-to-seek sentence highlighting synced to playback
- **Article import** — paste any URL and Readability extracts the text (plus Android share-target support)
- **Text cleanup** — skip citations, shorten URLs, spell vowel-less acronyms, strip markdown before synthesis
- **Voice preview** — one-click preview for each voice with session-cached audio
- **Pronunciation dictionary** — custom word/replacement pairs persisted in localStorage
- **Generation stats** — elapsed time, chars/s throughput, audio duration, realtime speed factor
- **Cancel button** — abort generation mid-run, keep partial results
- **Voice blending** — weighted mix of 2-4 Kokoro voices via custom style tensors (e.g. `af_heart(2)+af_bella(1)`)
- **EPUB import** — chapter-aware parsing with TOC title extraction, queued for batch generation
- **Persistent job queue** — queue, pause, resume, and ZIP-download survive tab close via IndexedDB checkpointing
- **CPU mode** — persistent WASM switch for GPUs with corrupted WebGPU output

### Platform
- **Installable PWA** with service worker for offline app shell and per-build cache versioning
- **COOP/COEP headers** injected via service worker for SharedArrayBuffer threaded WASM
- **Content-Security-Policy** baked into production builds
- **Persistent storage** request + usage meter; clip library auto-evicts past a 200 MB cap
- **Media Session API** — lock-screen play/pause controls for generated audio
- **Dark and light themes** with `prefers-color-scheme` detection and zero-flash boot
- **Responsive layout** — works on desktop and mobile
- **Accessible** — ARIA progressbar, live status, native caption tracks, alert toasts, AA contrast ratios

**Key design decisions:**
- WASM q8 model files (~107 MB including tokenizer and 28 voice bins) load from the GitHub Pages site first, then fall back to Hugging Face with 429-aware retry
- Word-level SRT/VTT is opt-in and uses the HF-hosted `Kokoro-82M-v1.0-ONNX-timestamped` q8 graph plus duration-output alignment
- All audio generation and processing happens client-side — zero network calls after model download
- Web Worker isolates WASM/WebGPU inference from the main thread
- Service worker injects COOP/COEP headers to enable SharedArrayBuffer for threaded WASM on GitHub Pages

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project does not use GitHub Actions. Build and publish locally:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

The deploy script builds `dist/`, syncs the Pages-hosted Kokoro q8 model assets into `dist/models/`, and force-pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch from a disposable git worktree, so your working tree is never modified. Then in repository settings: **Pages** → Source: `gh-pages` branch, folder: `/`.

## Voice Catalog

28 voices spanning American and British English, graded A through F+:

| Grade | Voices |

| A- | Bella |
| B- | Nicole, Emma |
| C+ | Aoede, Kore, Sarah, Fenrir, Michael, Puck |
| C | Alloy, Nova, Isabella, Fable, George |
| C- | Sky |

| F+ | Adam |

## Model Details

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | Kokoro-82M v1.0 |
| Parameters | 82 million |
| ONNX source | `onnx-community/Kokoro-82M-v1.0-ONNX` |
| Sample rate | 24,000 Hz |
| WebGPU dtype | fp32 (~326 MB, HF-hosted) |
| WASM dtype | q8 (~92 MB, Pages-hosted) |
| Languages | English (US + British) |
| License | Apache-2.0 |

Supertonic is available as a separate English speed engine: 66M parameters, 10 voices, 44,100 Hz output, HF-hosted fp32 ONNX assets, OpenRAIL license.

Word timestamps are available as an opt-in Kokoro mode using `onnx-community/Kokoro-82M-v1.0-ONNX-timestamped`; the extra q8 model stays HF-hosted and powers word-level SRT/VTT plus follow-along highlighting.

## Roadmap

Planned features (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for details):

- Multilingual Kokoro pack (es/fr/it/pt/hi)
- Additional engine support (KittenTTS, Piper)
- Transformers.js v4 migration for WebGPU speedups
- M4B chaptered audiobook export
