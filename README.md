TTS4FREE is a static text-to-speech studio built for GitHub Pages. It runs Kokoro 82M in the browser through `kokoro-js` and Transformers.js, then exports generated speech as WAV files. If the model cannot run on a device, the app falls back to the browser Web Speech API for playback.

## Features

- Client-side Kokoro generation with no private TTS server.
- WAV download for Kokoro output.
- Optional per-line generation with ZIP download.
- English US and English British Kokoro voices.
- Browser speech fallback for wide compatibility.
- Dark default UI with a light theme toggle.
- Plain static build for GitHub Pages.

## Develop

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Verify

```powershell
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Deploy To GitHub Pages

This project does not use GitHub Actions. Build locally and push the generated `dist` folder to a `gh-pages` branch:

```powershell
npm run build
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```

Then enable GitHub Pages in repository settings with:

- Source: deploy from a branch
- Branch: `gh-pages`
- Folder: `/`

## Model Notes

The active model path is `onnx-community/Kokoro-82M-v1.0-ONNX`. The first Kokoro run downloads model assets from Hugging Face and caches them in the browser. The app itself remains static and hostable on GitHub Pages.

Multilingual Kokoro expansion is planned as a follow-up because `kokoro-js` v1.2.1 exposes a reliable English voice set in its runtime voice map.
